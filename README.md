I am writing this project to create a simple notepad in Python using Tkinter. This notepad GUI will consist of various menu like file and edit, using which all functionalities like saving the file, opening a file, editing, cut and paste can be done.

Now for creating this notepad, Python 3 and Tkinter(a Pythonâ€™s GUI package). should already be installed in your system.

Use this command to install Tkinter :

_pip install python-tk_
