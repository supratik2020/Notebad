I am writing this project to create a simple notepad in Python using Tkinter. This notepad GUI will consist of various menu like file and edit, using which all functionalities like saving the file, opening a file, editing, cut and paste can be done.

Now for creating this notepad, Python 3 and Tkinter(a Pythonâ€™s GUI package). should already be installed in your system.

Use this command to install Tkinter :

_pip install python-tk_

Note : messagebox is used to write the message in the white box called notepad and filedialog is used for the dialog box to appear when you are opening file from anywhere in your system or saving your file in a particular position or place.

To run this code, save it by the extension .py and then open cmd(command prompt) and move to the location of the file saved and then write the following

_python "filename".py _
and press enter and it will run. Or can be run directly by simply double clicking your .py extension file.
